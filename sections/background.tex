\section{Theoretical Framework and Literature Review}
\subsection{Valency Systems}
\citeauthor{tesniere1959}~(\cite*{tesniere1959}; trans. \cite*{tesniere2015}) is widely attributed as introducing the metaphor of valency into linguistics, although \citet{przepiorkowski2018} points out that \citet{peirce1897} was in fact the earliest.

Typological interest in valency is primarily focused on cross-linguistic mismatches, termed \textit{metataxis} by \citet{tesniere1959}.
