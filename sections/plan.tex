\section{Work plan}

This section presents the work plan and timeline for the thesis.

Work plan:

(1) language selection
(2) feature selection
(3) clustering 
(4) verb alignment list
(5) information theoretical metrics
(6) linguistic analysis

1->2->3;3->1;4->1;3+4->5->6

This thesis study is intended to be completed within roughly three months after the submission of this proposal even though the maximum time available for completing it remains six months.

Given time constraints, an iterative process is envisioned and priority will be put on completing a functional pipeline of the computational part already in the first month of the work, i.e. January, allowing for more flexibility later in the project. Iterative improvements will then be made upon the code and methodological modifications tested. The primary experimental parts should conclude by the end of second month to allow for time needed for the write-up and revisions in the final month.
