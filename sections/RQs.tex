\section{Research questions}

The aim of this thesis study is twofold: the first is exploratory and computational, namely whether the existing computational resources based on dependency grammar can be effectively utilized in quantitative typology; the second is investigative and typological, whether a corpus-based study of valency features reveals universal patterns in how languages organize their valency systems and possibly their strategies.


Will we see cross-lingual patterns or universals in how verb classes aggregate and within each cross-lingual clusters, different strategies being used to encode the verb classes. If a semantic universal exists for different levels of transitivity for example, this should show up in the verb classes.

Different strategies for the same construction, e.g. adpositions and case markings
