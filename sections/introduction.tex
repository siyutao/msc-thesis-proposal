\section{Introduction}


Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks, a multilingual collection of dependency treebanks based on a shared, cross-lingually consistent annotation scheme \citet{nivre2020} and currently covering 138 languages with 243 treebanks in release v2.11 \cite{universaldep}, has enabled significant advances to be made in the development of multilingual dependency parsers and other NLP tasks \citep{zeman2017, zeman2018}. This proposed thesis will explore its potential in typological research, namely through a cross-lingual quantitative study of verbal valency systems.
