\addsec{Abstract}
Issues of verbal valency has long occupied a central place in the study of argument structure and the interface between lexicon and grammar. However, the cross-lingual comparison of valency systems and their general typology have proved challenging due to both disagreements on the linguistic basis of comparison and the difficulty in arriving at categorical types. For this thesis, I propose clustering experiments on the automatic induction of valency frames and of verb classes using morphosyntactically annotated data from the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks and the interpretation and analysis of the results through information-theoretic metrics of complexity and similarity. The aim of the proposed quantitative typological study is to explore the utility and limits of unsupervised clustering methods and dependency-annotated corpora in the cross-lingual comparison of verbal valency systems, in hopes that it may also yield quantitative insights on the complex issue.
