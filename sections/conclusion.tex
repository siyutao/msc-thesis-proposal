\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This thesis aims to contribute to the study of valency by using corpus linguistic approaches. The aim of study is not dissimilar to that of projects such as ValPaL or studies by \citet{say2014} but instead of focusing on a limited set of samples, the aim is to make the best use of the available cross-lingual corpora while still basing the study in a consistent theoretical framework. Exploring linguistic universals regarding the organization of verb lexicon and valency systems contributes to the overall project of typological studies, as well as shedding new light on the development of valency theories, which have thus far been driven by introspective studies of single languages or contrastive studies of two languages.

In the process of doing so, computational methods and their applicability will also be explored.
